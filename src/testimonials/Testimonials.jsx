Still we had never travelled to North east frequently, this being our first visit to Gangtok, Pelling and Darjeeling. All thanks to Swaraj Travels and specially to Abhijit Dada who suggested this region for our trip and organizing, guiding us with a great plan and comfortable schedule. Through the mountains, we could see all the views right at the time they were at their peak! It was wonderful to live right upon the valley in Gangtok, to see the Kanchan Ganga right from our hotel at Pelling and the whole city view right outside our Darjeeling stay! Overall, it was a memorable and mesmerizing journey indeed!"},
